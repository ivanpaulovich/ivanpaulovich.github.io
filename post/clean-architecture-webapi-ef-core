You may have noticed that I enjoy designing applications which business uses cases are decoupled from frameworks and libraries. I published several projects, tools and articles about Hexagonal and Clean Architecture styles,  I see a lot of value by investing time and effort to understand the use cases before digging into database structures or the user interface.
For that reason, I am gonna share a demo application for a simple WebApi that decouples the business (Use Cases + Entities) from the Entity Framework and the WebApi front end.

The project is available in GitHub at [Clean Architecture with WebApi and Entity Framework Core](https://github.com/ivanpaulovich/clean-architecture-webapi-ef-core) and you are invited to give a stargazer or follow me.

One important think you need to keep in mind is that despise the project relates to an implementation of a WebApi and EF, these details are completely decoupled from the Use Cases, the business is Clean!
